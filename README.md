**Telegram bot that gets info from Central Bank SOAP service**

Implemented two commands:
- `/key_rate` - Receives the key rate for the current day from the Ð¡entral bank API and returns it to the user in the telegram chat.
- `/inflation` - Receives the inflation rate for the current day from the Central bank API and returns it to the user in the telegram chat.

For testing, you should create own telegram bot, issue and set it's token in environment variables with "TBOT" key.
